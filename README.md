# PDMB
Personal Download Manager Bot
### This telegram bot that has been written with [python-telegram-bot](https://python-telegram-bot.org/).

# What is it? why should I use it?
Well, it all comes from the time that I was outside, I found lots of useful links and because I didn't have my laptop around me or I didn't want to use my phones' Internet, I was planning to download them after I came home.
but, well, mostly I forgot about the links :|
so I developed this Bot, so I can download anything I wanted while my laptop is on at home.

## It can:
	- Get links and download.
	- Get a file with links content and download.
	- Show which download is completed.

## What I need?
	- A telegram-bot Token.
	- install aria2c on your computer.
